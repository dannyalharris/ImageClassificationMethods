# ImageClassificationMethods

In this project, we are using machine learning to recognize two types of image which are comb and brush.

There are many methods that we can use to classify the images. The methods are stated as follow:

 image classfication methods:
 1. manual
 2. automated:
    1. pixel based
    2. object oriented
    3. supervise
    	1. parametric
        	1.	maximum likehood
        	2.	maximum distance
        	3.	mahalanobis distance
        2.	non-parametric
        	1. neural network
        	2. support vector machine
        	3. k nearest neighbor
        	4. spectral angle mapper
        	5. fuzzyset classification logic
        	6. decision tree
        	7. random forest
        	8. parallel pipe
			9. naive bayes
    4. unsupervise
    	1. k means
    	2.  iso data
    5. hybrid
    	1. classifier ensemble
    	2. multiple classifier system
